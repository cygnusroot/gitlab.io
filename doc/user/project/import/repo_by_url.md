## CI/CD-only project

>[Introduced][ee-4642] in [GitLab Premium][eep] 10.6.

Instead of importing the repo directly to GitLab, you can connect your repository
as a CI/CD-only project.

This will set up [repository mirroring](../../../workflow/repository_mirroring.md) and create a stripped down version of a project
that has issues, merge requests, container registry, wiki, and snippets disabled
but [can be re-enabled later on](../settings/index.md#sharing-and-permissions).

1. From your GitLab dashboard click **New project**
1. Switch to the **CI/CD only** tab
1. Follow the same import project steps (see above)
